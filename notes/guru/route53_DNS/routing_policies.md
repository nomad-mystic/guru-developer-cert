# Route53 Routing Policies 

#### Types 
* Simple
* Weighted

#### Simple 
This is the default routing policy when you create a new record set.
This is most commonly used whern you have a single resource that preforms a given function 
for your domain, for example, one web server that serves content for the http://acloud.guru website.

#### Weighted
Weighted Routing Policies let you split your traffic based on different weights assigned.

For example you can set 10% of your traffic to US-EAST-1 and 90% to US-WEST-1
