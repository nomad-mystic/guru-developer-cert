# DNS 101

DNS searches for a name that is registered to a IP address turning 

http://0.0.0.0 to http://nomadmystic.com 

##### IPv4 vs IPv6
IPv4 is a 32 bit field has over 4 billion different addresses (4,294,967,296)

IPv6 solved the depletion issue and has an address space of 128 bits which in theory is 340 undecillion 

##### VPC are IPv6 compatible

#### Top Level Domains 
The last word in a domain name represents the "Top Level Domain"
The second word in the domain name is known as a second level domain (this is optional)
* .com
* .edu 
* .org
* .gov
* .com.uk
* .gov.au

These top level domains are controlled by the "Internet Assigned Numbers Authority" (IANA) ina root zone databse which is essentially a database of all available top level domains
You can view by going to [IANA website](http://www.iana.org/domains/root/db)

#### Domain Registrars
Because all of the names in a given domain name have to be unique there needs to be a way to 
organize this all so that domain names aren't duplicated. This is where domain registrars com in. 
A registrar is an authority that can assign domain names directly under one or more top-level domains. 
These domains are registered with [InterNIC](https://www.internic.net/), a service ICANN, which enforces uniqueness of 
domain names across the internet. Each domain name becomes registered in a central database known as the [WhoIS](https://whois.icann.org/en)
database.

Popular domain registrars are Godaddy.com, 123-reg.com.uk etc


#### SOA Records
##### The SOA record stores information about;
* The name of the server that supplied the data for the zone 
* The administrator of the zone
* The current version of the data file
* The number of seconds a secondary name server should wait before checking for updates 
* The number of seconds a secondary name server wait before retrying a failed zone transfer
* The maximum number of seconds that a secondary name server can use data before it must either be refreshed or expire 
* The default number of seconds for the time-to-live file on resource records 

#### NS Records 
NS stands for "Name Server" records and are used by Top Level Domain severs to direct traffic to the Content DNS
which contains the authoritative DNS records

#### A Records 
An "A" record is the fundamental type of DNS record and the "A" in A record stands for "Address".
The "A" record is used by a computer to translate the name of the domain to the IP address.
For example http://www.acloud.guru might point to http://123.10.10.80

#### TTL (Time To Live)
The length that a DNS record is cached on either the Resolving Server or the users own local PC is equal to the value of the TTL in seconds.
The lower the TTL, the faster changes to DNS records take to propagate throughout the internet.

#### CNAMES
A Canonical Name (CNAME) can be used to resolve one domain name to another.
For example, you may have a mobile site with the domain name http://m.acloud.guru that is used for when 
users browse to your domain name on their mobile devices. 
You may also want the name http://mobile.acloud.guru to resolve to this same address. 

#### Alias Records (AWS Only)
Alias records are used to map resource records sets in your hosted zone to ELB, CloudFront distributions 
, or S3 buckets that are configured as websites

Alias records work like CNAME records in that you can map one DNS name to another "target" DNS name

Key Difference - A CNAME can't be used for naked domain names (zone apex record).
You can't have a CNAME for http://acloud.guru, it must be either an A record or an Alias.

Alias resource records sets can save you time because Amazon Route 53 automatically recognizes changes in the
record sets that the alias resource record set refers to.

For example, suppose an alias resource record set for example.com points to an ELB at lb1-1234.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com.
If the IP address of the ELB changes, Amazon Route 53 will automatically reflect those changes in the DNS 
answers for example.com without any changes to the hosted zone that contains resource record sets for example.com.


### Exam Tips 
* ELB's don't have pre-defined IPv4 addresses, you resolve to them using a DNS name 
* Understand the difference between an Alias Record and a CNAME 
* Given the choice, always choose an Alias Record over a CNAME
