# Route53 and DNS 

#### DNS 101

DNS searches for a name that is registered to a IP address turning 

http://0.0.0.0 to http://nomadmystic.com 

##### IPv4 vs IPv6
IPv4 is a 32 bit field has over 4 billion different addresses (4,294,967,296)

IPv6 solved the depletion issue and has an address space of 128 bits which in theory is 340 undecillion 

##### VPC are IPv6 compatible

#### Top Level Domains 
The last word in a domain name represents the "Top Level Domain"
The second word in the domain name is known as a second level domain (this is optional)
* .com
* .edu 
* .org
* .gov
* .com.uk
* .gov.au

These top level domains are controlled by the "Internet Assigned Numbers Authority" (IANA) ina root zone databse which is essentially a database of all available top level domains
You can view by going to [IANA website](http://www.iana.org/domains/root/db)

#### Domain Registrars
Because all of the names in a given domain name have to be unique there needs to be a way to 
organize this all so that domain names aren't duplicated. This is where domain registrars com in. 
A registrar is an authority that can assign domain names directly under one or more top-level domains. 
These domains are registered with [InterNIC](https://www.internic.net/), a service ICANN, which enforces uniqueness of 
domain names across the internet. Each domain name becomes registered in a central database known as the [WhoIS](https://whois.icann.org/en)
database.

Popular domain registrars are Godaddy.com, 123-reg.com.uk etc
